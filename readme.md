### Learning Objectives
This class is an overview of emerging technologies and how they shape the production of artwork and education. This class covers a wide range of creative uses for technology and allows students to experiment with them, ultimately to produce artwork and share with their own students. Students will learn how to investigate an emerging technology and anticipate pedagogical challenges in a wide range of classrooms. 
- Understand discourse around emerging technologies 
- Develop skills to learn and teach new skills dynamically
- Develop skills to communicate technical skills in lesson plans 
- Learn to produce technical documentation

### Critique Policy
Critiques are critical opportunities for artistic development and growth. Students are expected to be both supportive and constructively critical with each other. You are expected to engage actively in critique and be prepared to engage deeply with concept and technical aspects of projects. 


### Academic Code of Conduct
The most common offence under the Academic Code of Conduct is plagiarism, which the Code defines as “the presentation of the work of another person as one’s own or without proper acknowledgement.” This includes material copied word for word from books, journals, Internet sites, professor’s course notes, etc. It refers to material that is paraphrased but closely resembles the original source. It also includes for example the work of a fellow student, an answer on a quiz, data for a lab report, a paper or assignment completed by another student. It might be a paper purchased from any source. Plagiarism does not refer to words alone –it can refer to copying images, graphs, tables and ideas. “Presentation” is not limited to written work. It includes oral presentations, computer assignments and artistic works. Finally, if you translate the
work of another person into any other language and do not cite the source, this is also plagiarism.
      
In Simple Words:   
Do not copy, paraphrase or translate anything from anywhere without saying where you obtained it.
